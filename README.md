## the C++ implemententation of LFFD with ncnn 
  I have implemented the LFFD  referring to the official python implementation
  the Inference time of LFFD with the input shape of 320x240 is about 20ms on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 CPU
  
  paper:[LFFD: A Light and Fast Face Detector for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10633)
  
  official github: [LFFD](https://github.com/YonghaoHe/A-Light-and-Fast-Face-Detector-for-Edge-Devices)
  
## TODO(you can refer this implementation to do more)
 - [x] MNN demo finished
 - [x] openvino demo: mxnet model-->onnx-->openvino
 - [x] TensorRT demo: mxnet model --> onnx-->trt engine
